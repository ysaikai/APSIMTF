###Abstract
APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) is capable of creating high-fidelity simulations of diverse agricultural systems. It is used by both academics and practitioners for many different purposes, one of which is optimisation of management decisions. When addressing realistic dynamic optimisation problems, an exhaustive search for the best practice becomes computationally impossible. Deep reinforcement learning is a viable approach to solving such challenging problems. APSIMTF is a software bridge between APSIM and TensorFlow, enabling researchers to implement their own deep reinforcement learning algorithms in APSIM environments. This paper describes the design principle of APSIMTF, demonstrates how it works using a scenario of optimal irrigation scheduling, and discusses existing challenges, suggestions, and outlook for the further development.
